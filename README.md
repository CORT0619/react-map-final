### Installation
The first step in getting up and running with this project is cloning this repo. 

After you've cloned this repo, you'll need to navigate to the project folder and run the command `npm install`. Once all dependencies have been installed you can then run the application by typing in `npm start`. Once the application has started you can either type in a location, either by name or category, and under the search box a list of locations will be filtered for you to choose from.

Once you have the desired places you can then click on one of the list items and then the marker will start jumping on the google map to the right so you'll know just where your desired location lies.
